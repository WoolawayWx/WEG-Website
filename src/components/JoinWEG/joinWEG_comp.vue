            <p>Cade with WoolawayWx takes weather and emergency response to a whole new level. After seeing the disconnect during his time in the fire service, he decided to lead the way with a revolutionary idea, a group dedicated to weather for first responders and other public safety entities. Using the knowledge from the fire service working alongside law enforcement and EMS, and combining that with weather knowledge obtained in the pursuit of a meteorology degree from the University of Oklahoma, Cade has created a unique and kind group that benefits first responders in a way that wasnâ€™t previously done. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Weather Emergency Group is always looking to expand to more members in more departments. From the website to the Facebook group to the command group text, all assets are free of charge and open to departments in Southwest Missouri, Northeast Oklahoma, and Northwest Arkansas. Head over the the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/wegofficial/">Facebook Group</a> to join today, and if you are a command role in your department, shoot Cade Woolaway a message, or a message to WoolawayWx, or feel <a href="mailto:cade@woolawaywx.com">free to send an email</a> and we can get you added to the command group! Look forward to working with you soon! </p>
