    <h1>About WEG</h1>
  <h3>Our Mission is to bring the Emergency services sectors across Southwest Missouri, Northwest Arkansas, and Northeast Oklahoma together to protect life and property.</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Weather Emergency Group is a privately operated organization that specializes in providing detailed, customized weather data to fire departments, law enforcement, emergency management, and other public safety agencies. Unlike widely available public forecasts, the group's services are tailored specifically to meet the unique needs of emergency responders.

The organization was founded by Cade Woolaway, a meteorology student that studied at the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/ags/meteorology">University of Oklahoma</a> and is currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Environmental Science at the <a href="https://majors.missouri.edu/environmental-sciences-atmosphere-bs/">University of Missouri</a>. With a background in firefighting and emergency response, Cade combines his expertise in weather science with firsthand experience in public safety. This unique blend of knowledge enables him to deliver critical weather insights and communicate risk in a way that resonates with those in the emergency response field.</p>
